## Folders step1 - step5 cover following: 

- The problem with the global scope - overuse global scope (step1)
  - build the fake chat application
  - use global scope freely
  - setting up project for the upcomng steps

  In this step we introduced the problem of overusing the global scope. ALl methods are public and all of them are accessible by the user.

  To solve that problem we will use two design patterns: **object literal design pattern** and **namespace pattern**.

- Moving to one object and namespace (step2 - coming soon)
- The Module design pattern (step3 - coming soon)
- The Module Reveal pattern (step4 - coming soon)
- Controlling the global access completetly (ste5 - coming soon)
