**What is Singleton Design Pattern?**
This Pattern is used when we want to have one instance of this specific object. Also it provides global point of access to that instance.

This pattern is very unique and you want to make sure that you will not overuse it.
It has 3 core rules:
- the delayed instantiation of an object
- constant interface to gain access to the object (what is [interface](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2866987/what-is-the-definition-of-interface-in-object-oriented-programming) in oop)
- one instance of the object in one application
