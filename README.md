## Tutorial about design patterns in Javascript

I am going to create a fake chat application in which I will demonstrate usage of different types of design patterns by producing a problem and solving it by using relevant pattern.

##### **my_first_design_patterns** have 5 directories (step1- step5) which cover following: 

- The problem with the global scope - overuse global scope (step1)
- Moving to one object and namespace (step2)
- The Module design pattern (step3)
- The Module Reveal pattern (step4)
- Controlling the global access completetly (step5)
