## Tutorial about design patterns in Javascript

### I am going to create a fake chat application in which I will demonstrate usage of different types of design patterns by producing a problem and solving it by using relevant pattern.

## Branches step1 - step5 cover following: 

#### The problem with the global scope - overuse global scope (branch step1)
#### Moving to one object and namespace (branch step2 - coming soon)
#### The Module design pattern (branch step3 - coming soon)
#### The Module Reveal pattern (branch step4 - coming soon)
#### Controlling the global access completetly (branch ste5 - coming soon)
