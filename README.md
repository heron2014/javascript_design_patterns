## Tutorial about design patterns in Javascript

I am going to create a fake chat application in which I will demonstrate usage of different types of design patterns by producing a problem and solving it by using relevant pattern.

##### **my_first_design_patterns** have 5 directories (step1- step5) which covers following: 

- The problem with the global scope - overuse global scope (step1)
- Moving to one object and namespace (step2)
- The Module design pattern (step3)
- The Module Reveal pattern (step4)
- Controlling the global access completetly (step5)

##### **creational_design_patterns** have 6 directories (step1-step6) which covers following:

Creational Design Patterns are patterns that relates to creation of objects. These are:

- The Singleton design pattern (step1 - coming soon)
- The Factory desig pattern (step2 - coming soon)
- The Abstract Factory design pattern (step3 - coming soon)
- The Builder design pattern (step4 - coming soon)
- The Builder design pattern continue (step5 - coming soon)
